# Hack-The-Valley
To deal with the problem of litter, this web application encourages citizen-led environmental cleanups! It does this by introducing a centralized litter database, where citizens can post about areas with high levels of trash so it can be cleaned up during community pickup days. As an extra incentive, users gain points whenever they report/resolve litter piles, which can be exchanged for donations to a charity of their choice!

This product was created by Chelsea, Jeffery, and Joshua for Hack the Valley 2022.
